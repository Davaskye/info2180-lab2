            <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

                Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science are two distinct disciplines, with overlapping 
                methodologies but with rather different goals. AI is a branch of computer science and is concerned with 
                construction and deployment of intelligent agents as computer programs, and also with understanding the 
                behavior of these artifacts. The core scientific goal of AI is to understand the basic principles of intelligent 
                behavior that apply equally to animal and artificial systems. Almost all of the work is mathematical or computational 
                in character and much of the literature is technique oriented.
                <br><br>
                Cognitive science is an explicitly interdisciplinary field that has participation not only from AI, but also from 
                linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and subfields of other social and biological sciences. The unifying goal of 
                cognitive science is to understand and model human intelligence, using the full range of findings and methodologies 
                of the complementary disciplines. As one would expect, a wide range of techniques from the mathematical, behavioral, 
                social, and biological sciences are employed. Cognitive science, in contrast with AI, is defined more by phenomena than 
                by methodology. There are research groups that are active in both AI and cognitive science, but they tend to produce different 
                types of reports for journals and conferences in the two areas.

            <h2>Alpha Zero</h2>
            <p class = "date">September 28th, 2021 by Davaskye DeBique</p>

                AlphaZero is a computer program developed by artificial intelligence research company DeepMind to master the games of
                 chess, shogi and go. This algorithm uses an approach similar to AlphaGo Zero.
                <br><br>
                On December 5, 2017, the DeepMind team released a preprint introducing AlphaZero, which within 24 hours of training 
                achieved a superhuman level of play in these three games by defeating world-champion programs Stockfish, elmo, and the 
                three-day version of AlphaGo Zero. In each case it made use of custom tensor processing units (TPUs) that the Google programs 
                were optimized to use. AlphaZero was trained solely via "self-play" using 5,000 first-generation TPUs to generate the games and 
                64 second-generation TPUs to train the neural networks, all in parallel, with no access to opening books or endgame tables. 
                After four hours of training, DeepMind estimated AlphaZero was playing chess at a higher Elo rating than Stockfish 8; after 9 hours 
                of training, the algorithm defeated Stockfish 8 in a time-controlled 100-game tournament (28 wins, 0 losses, and 72 draws). The trained 
                algorithm played on a single machine with four TPUs.
                <br><br>
                DeepMind's paper on AlphaZero was published in the journal Science on 7 December 2018. In 2019 DeepMind published a new paper detailing MuZero, 
                a new algorithm able to generalise on AlphaZero work, playing both Atari and board games without knowledge of the rules or representations of the game.
